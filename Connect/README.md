### This Python Notebook will show you how to set and authenticate a connection to your ElasticSearch

# What is Eland?

- [Eland](https://github.com/elastic/eland/) is a Python Elasticsearch client for exploring and analyzing data in Elasticsearch with a familiar Pandas-compatible API.

- Where possible the package uses existing Python APIs and data structures to make it easy to switch between numpy, pandas, scikit-learn to their Elasticsearch powered equivalents. In general, the data resides in Elasticsearch and not in memory, which allows Eland to access large datasets stored in Elasticsearch.

- Eland also provides tools to upload trained machine learning models from your common libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, and LightGBM into Elasticsearch.
